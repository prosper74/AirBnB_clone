# AirBnB Clone - The Console

### Description:
AirBnB Clone - The Console is a command-line interface (CLI) application that serves as the backend for a simplified version of the popular online accommodation booking platform, AirBnB. This project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of AirBnB, allowing users to manage and interact with properties, users, and booking information through a text-based interface.

### Command interpreter
The command interpreter for the AirBnB Clone project serves as the primary interface for users to interact with the backend functionality of the application. It provides a text-based environment where users can execute commands to perform various operations related to managing properties, users, bookings, and more.

### How it Works:
- Upon launching the command interpreter, users are greeted with a prompt indicating that the console is ready to accept commands.
- Users input commands along with any required arguments or options, then press Enter to execute the command.
- The interpreter processes the command, performs the specified operation, and provides feedback or output based on the result.

### Features:
- Property Management: Users can create, update, delete, and view properties.
- User Management: Administrators can manage user accounts, including creation, deletion, and permission management.
- Booking Management: Users can make bookings for properties and view booking details.
- Search and Filter: Users can search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, amenities, etc.

### Example:
Here's an example of how a user might interact with the command interpreter:

1. User types create user JohnDoe john@example.com password123 and presses Enter to create a new user with the name "JohnDoe," email "john@example.com," and password "password123."
2. User types list users and presses Enter to view a list of all users in the system, including the newly created user "JohnDoe."
3. User types book property 1234 2024-03-01 2024-03-05 and presses Enter to book a property with ID 1234 for the dates March 1st, 2024 to March 5th, 2024.
4. User types search property --location New York and presses Enter to search for properties located in New York.

### Technologies Used:
- Python: The core programming language used for developing the backend logic.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Built using the cmd module in Python to provide a user-friendly text-based interface.
- Serialization: Serialization techniques such as JSON are used to store and retrieve data persistently.

# For this Project we are expected to know the following

### How to create a Python package?

To create a Python package, you need to organize your code into a directory structure and include a special file called `__init__.py`. This file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package. You can then use the import statement to access modules and objects within the package.

### How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module?

You can create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module, which provides a framework for building simple command-line interpreters. You can subclass the cmd.Cmd class and define methods for each command you want to support. The cmd module handles command parsing, completion, and help text generation.

### What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project?

Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure they work correctly. In a large project, you can implement unit testing using testing frameworks like unittest, pytest, or nose. Write test cases for each unit or function in your codebase to verify its behavior under different conditions.

### How to serialize and deserialize a Class?

`Serialization` is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML. `Deserialization` is the reverse process of converting the serialized data back into an object. In Python, you can use libraries like pickle, json, or marshal for `serialization` and `deserialization`.

### How to write and read a JSON file?

You can write JSON data to a file using the `json.dump()` function and read JSON data from a file using the `json.load()` function. These functions allow you to serialize Python objects to JSON format and deserialize JSON data into Python objects, respectively.

### How to manage datetime?

In Python, you can use the `datetime` module to work with dates and times. You can create `datetime` objects representing specific dates and times, perform arithmetic operations on them, format them as strings, and convert them to different time zones.

### What is an UUID?

UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It is a `128-bit` identifier that is guaranteed to be unique across space and time. `UUIDs` are commonly used to identify objects or entities in distributed systems where uniqueness is critical.

### What is *args and how to use it?

`*args` is a special syntax in Python that allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. It collects any additional positional arguments passed to the function into a tuple. You can use `*args` when you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to the function.

### What is **kwargs and how to use it?

`**kwargs` is similar to `*args`, but it collects additional keyword arguments passed to a function into a dictionary instead of a tuple. This allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.

### How to handle named arguments in a function?

Named arguments in a function are specified by providing the argument name followed by a colon and the argument value (name=value). Inside the function, you can access named arguments using their names. Named arguments provide clarity and flexibility when calling functions, especially for functions with many parameters.
